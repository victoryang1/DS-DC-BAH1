## Part 1: Pitch
> Test and validate 2–3 initial ideas.

In the field of data science, projects are practical. One of the best ways to quickly test ideas is to share your ideas with others and get feedback. Start by reviewing the requirements and [suggested data sets](./datasets.md), then generate a list of 2–3 potential ideas you'd like to pursue. 

**Requirements**
1. Generate 2–3 different possible problem statements (of at least 250 words each).
    - State the questions you seek to answer, data set suggestions, and possible challenges.
2. Create a written pitch for each possibility that can be shared with your instructor and classmates.
3. Submit your pitch in this form https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfdjB96BaqT7seRGGNZHwsA2O8u1beO8ZXQUZ8jaII7tVlJ5Q/viewform?usp=sf_link.

## Part 2: Proposal
> Select data and outline specific goals.

Based on the feedback your received in Part 1, expand on your initial proposal. Spend more time looking through the data sets and outline the initial logic of your approach in a detailed problem statement. 

For this write up, describe your hypothesis and assumptions, articulate your specific aim and success metrics, and state any risks or limitations. Make sure you've also explained which data set you've selected for this project and why.

As before, make sure to review the requirements and [suggested data sets](./datasets.md) while preparing your proposal.

**Requirements**
1. Restate your specific problem statement.
2. Expand on your initial proposal by including:
   - Hypothesis/assumptions
   - Goals and success metrics
   - Risks or limitations
3. Articulate the specific data set you've chosen and why.
4. This information should be also be communicated here https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflZVDk8s30_OaFeSAcRN4K_vQHuzxllgHNXz1lLHnJRY2jJQ/viewform.

## Part 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
> Clean and analyze your data set.

Exploratory data analysis is a crucial step in the data workflow. Create a Jupyter Notebook that explores your data both mathematically and visually. You should explore features, apply descriptive statistics, look at distributions, and determine how to handle sampling or any missing values.

**Requirements**
1. Create an exploratory data analysis notebook.
2. Include statistical analysis and EDA visualizations.
3. Determine how to handle sampling or missing values.
4. Submit or share EDA notebook as per your instructor's directions.

> Note: Your EDA should include the first part of your modelling.

<a name="notebook"></a>
## Part 4: Technical Notebook
> Build and document a working model.

By now, you're ready to apply your modeling skills to make machine learning predictions. Your goal for this project is to develop a working predictive model or process to resolve your problem statement. You should document your work in a technical notebook that can be shared with your peers.

Build upon your earlier EDA notebook, expanding on your statistical analysis, and include your final model, along with any specific performance metrics and evaluation criteria. Organize your information clearly for an external audience, including a table of contents and clearly demarcated sections, using markdown to create subheaders or descriptions as needed. Finally, include comments on all of your code.

**Requirements**
1. A detailed Jupyter Notebook with a summary of your: statistical analysis, model, and evaluation metrics.
2. Use markdown to clearly organize all of your notebook's information.
3. Include comments on all of your code.

> Note: Here are some things to consider in your notebook: sample size, correlations, feature importance, unexplained variance or outliers, variable selection, train/test comparison, and any relationships between your target and independent variables.  You should have half of your modelling done before class on Friday September 15th.

## Part 5: Presentation
> Summarize and present your findings.

As a data scientist, you'll frequently be asked to present your findings to a mixed audience of both technical and non-technical stakeholders, so it's important to practice summarizing and breaking down your process for different levels of expertise. 

First, create a short summary of your problem and solution for a general audience. Keep it short and concise (i.e., one page). Think of this as an executive summary or — if you prefer — frame it as a blog post.

Second, create a presentation that reviews your project in more detail but still balances information for a general audience. Use visuals, explain your goals and approach, compare your results against initial metrics, and describe the impact of your findings. Be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

*Optional*: As a stretch challenge, try creating an interactive demo of your model in action, explain how you would deploy your model in a production environment, or discuss how to evaluate model performance over time.

**Requirements**
1. Create a one-page summary write up (or blog post) that explains your project for a non-technical audience.

2. Create a detailed presentation (e.g., slide deck) that explains your model findings for a general audience (i.e., a mix of technical and non-technical stakeholders).

3. Your presentation should include:
   - A problem statement.
   - Initial metrics and assumptions.
   - Your approach and process.
   - A data model.
   - Your performance evaluation (compared to original success metrics).
   - The impact of your findings and any recommendations.
   - Suggestions for implementation or next steps.

 4. *Optional:* Create/host an interactive demo of your model, explain how to deploy your model, or describe how you would evaluate performance over time.
