## Materials We Provide

| Topic | Description | Link |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Starter Code | Project Prompts and Description | [Here](./imdb.ipynb) |
| Solution Code | Sample solutions for project questions | [Here](./Solution-Code/imdb_solutions.ipynb) |
| Dataset | Chipotle Dataset | [Here](./data/imdb_1000.csv) |

> Note: Instructors should withold providing project solutions until students have submitted their drafts. In order to do so, avoid forking this repo and instead clone down materials locally, create a new repository in your student org, and upload materials manually.

## Project Objective

For project two, you will complete a serious of exercises exploring movie rating data from IMDb.

For these exercises, you will be conducting basic exploratory data analysis on Chipotle's order data, looking to answer such questions as:
  - What is the average rating per genre? 
  - How many different actors are in a movie?

This process will help you practice your data analysis skills while becoming comfortable with Pandas.

## Project Requirements

In a Jupyter Notebook, create working solutions for all of the questions above.

Your notebook should include:

1. Text for each question, copy and pasted from this file (preferably in markdown).
2. A working solution to each problem.
   - Do not include test, practice, or broken code (*unless you were unable to create a working solution*).
3. Comments for all of your code.
   - In your comments, describe any assumptions you made in order to solve these problems.

4. **Bonus**: In programming (and life), there may be multiple ways to solve a problem. After completing our challenges, go back and see if you can think of any other valid methods!

## Rubric

For all projects, requirements will be evaluated on a simple point scale of 0, 1, or 2. 

Score | Expectations
:--- | :---
**0** | _Incomplete._
**1** | _Does not meet expectations._
**2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_

Additionally, instructors will provide feedback on required portions of your project.

## Submission

Your instructor will explain how to submit your assignment. Typically, this is done either by:

 - Creating a repository in your github profile, hosting your materials, and sharing a link with your instructor. [or]
 - Forking the project repository, adding your solutions, and submitting a pull request back to the relevant repo.
