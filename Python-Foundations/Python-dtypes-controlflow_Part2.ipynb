    "## Why Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Python was created by Guido van Rossum and released back in 1991. Since then, Python has greatly grown as a high-level, general-purpose programming language with a huge open-source community supporting it. The language was developed to emphasize readability of code (specifically, white-space use and syntax). \"The Zen of Python\" is a poem that explains the nature of the Python functionality.\n",

    "_Beautiful is better than ugly.  \n",
    "Explicit is better than implicit.  \n",
    "Simple is better than complex.  \n",
    "Complex is better than complicated.  \n",
    "Flat is better than nested.  \n",
    "Sparse is better than dense.  \n",
    "Readability counts.  \n",
    "Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules. Although practicality beats purity.   \n",
    "Errors should never pass silently.  \n",
    "Unless explicitly silenced.  \n",
    "In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.  \n",
    "There should be one — and preferably only one — obvious way to do it. Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.\n",
    "Now is better than never.  \n",
    "Although never is often better than right now.  \n",
    "If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.  \n",
    "If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.   \n",

    "## Why Python for Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### General Purpose, Open Source, and Readability\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the more prominent reasons Python has been so widely adopted for data science.\n",
    "\n",
    "**General purpose:** Python was not intended just to be used for software development or website development. Instead it comes with the basic building blocks you need to develop anything you want out of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Open Source:** Going back to the \"basic building blocks\" point; a large open-source community has already created hundreds of libraries containing combinations of the foundation blocks to create more specific toolsets. Here are a few examples:\n",
    "- Requests: Interacting with websites\n",
    "- Django: Python web framework\n",
    "- Pandas: Data scientists' best friend\n",
    "- Pyglet: GUI application building\n",
    "- TensorFlow: Google's machine learning library\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Readability:** They're called programming languages because learning them is similar to learning a written language, but instead of learning how to communicate with a person, you're learning how to communicate with a computer. When a foreign language is similar to your native language it is much easier to pick up. The same can be said for Python, whose general flow makes it a lot easier for humans to read and interpret code.\n"

    "**Integers:** Whole numbers from negative infinity to infinity, such as 1, 0, -5, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Float:** Short for \"floating point number,\" any rational number, usually used with decimals, such as 2.8 or 3.14159.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strings:** A set of letters, numbers, or other characters, e.g., \"Frank Underwood, I am your father.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tuples:** A list with a fixed number of elements, e.g., in x=(1,2,3), the parentheses makes it a tuple. x = (\"Kirk\", \"Picard\", \"Spock\")\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lists:** A list without a fixed number of elements, e.g., in x=[1,2,3], note the square brackets a list. x = [\"Lord\", \"of\", \"the\", \"Rings\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dictionaries**: A type with multiple elements, e.g., x = {1: 'a','b': 2,3: 3} where you address the elements with, e.g., a text.\n",
