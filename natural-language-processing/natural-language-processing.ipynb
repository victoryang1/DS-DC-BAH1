    "\n",
    "In data science, we are often asked to analyze unstructured text or make a predictive model using it. Unfortunately, most data science techniques require numeric data. NLP libraries provide a tool set of methods to convert unstructured text into meaningful numeric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analysis:** NLP techniques provide tools to allow us to understand and analyze large amounts of text. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Analyze the positivity/negativity of comments on different websites. \n",
    "    - Extract key words from meeting notes and visualize how meeting topics change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vectorizing for machine learning:** When building a machine learning model, we typically must transform our data into numeric features. This process of transforming non-numeric data such as natural language into numeric features is called vectorization. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Understanding related words. Using stemming, NLP lets us know that \"swim\", \"swims\", and \"swimming\" all refer to the same base word. This allows us to reduce the number of features used in our model.\n",
    "    - Identifying important and unique words. Using TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency), we can identify which words are most likely to be meaningful in a document."

    "Later in the course, we will explore in-depth how to use the Naive Bayes classifier with text. Naive Bayes is a very popular classifier because it has minimal storage requirements, is fast, can be tuned easily with more data, and has found very useful applications in text classificaton. For example, Paul Graham originally proposed using Naive Bayes to detect spam in his [Plan for Spam](http://www.paulgraham.com/spam.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "As you approach the table, you see that the last number the ball landed on was Red-3. With a frequentist mindset, you know that the ball is just as likely to land on Red-3 again given that every slot on the wheel has an equal opportunity of 1 in 37.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it is against your intuition to bet on red on the next roll. You think that because it was red this time it is more likely to be black next time. You don't know why, but in the back of your mind you believe that the ball is more likely to land on black given it landed on red previously than it is to land on red twice in a row.\n",

    "Let's pretend we have an email with three words: \"Send money now.\" We'll use Naive Bayes to classify it as **ham or spam.** (\"Ham\" just means not spam. It can include emails that look like spam but that you opt into!)\n",

    "\n",
    "- The \"naive\" assumption of Naive Bayes (that the features are conditionally independent) is critical to making these calculations simple.\n",

    "- The prior probability is much less relevant once you have a lot of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparing Naive Bayes With Other Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model training and prediction are very fast.\n",
    "- It's somewhat interpretable.\n",
    "- No tuning is required.\n",
    "- Features don't need scaling.\n",
    "- It's insensitive to irrelevant features (with enough observations).\n",
    "- It performs better than logistic regression when the training set is very small.\n",
    "\n",
    "Disadvantages of Naive Bayes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If \"spam\" is dependent on non-independent combinations of individual words, it may not work well.\n",
    "- Predicted probabilities are not well calibrated.\n",
    "- Correlated features can be problematic (due to the independence assumption).\n",
    "- It can't handle negative features (with Multinomial Naive Bayes).\n",
    "- It has a higher \"asymptotic error\" than logistic regression.\n",
