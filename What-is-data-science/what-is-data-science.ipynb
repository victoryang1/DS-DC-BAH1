So how do we distinguish data science from traditional analytics? A helpful comparison is that analytics is useful for extracting explicit insights from data — i.e., summary statistics, trends, correlations — while data science is a means of extracting implicit insights such as multivariable correlations, natural language processing, and machine learning models.  \n",
